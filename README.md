## Title

Employee Summary Template Engine

## Description

This project is a generator for a team of employees, so that their manager may have quick access to their contact information at any given time. The user can add one manager and an unlimited number of Engineers and Interns and then generate an html file in which each employee's information is listed onto individual Bootstrap cards when opened in a browser.
